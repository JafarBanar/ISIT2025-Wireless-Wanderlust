# Model Server Performance Report

## Load Test Results (100 concurrent requests)

### Request Statistics
- Total Requests: 100
- Successful Requests: 100 (100% success rate)
- Failed Requests: 0
- Total Test Duration: 22.05 seconds
- Throughput: 4.53 requests/second

### Latency Metrics
- Average Latency: 2.16 seconds
- Minimum Latency: ~33ms (per inference)
- Maximum Latency: ~55ms (per inference)
- 95th Percentile Latency: 2.57 seconds

### Server Performance
- Individual inference times are very consistent
- No errors or timeouts during the test
- Server handles concurrent requests efficiently
- Memory usage remains stable under load

## Recommendations

1. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Consider batch processing for multiple requests
   - Implement request queuing for better resource utilization
   - Add caching for frequently requested predictions

2. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Current setup can handle ~4.5 requests/second
   - For higher throughput, consider:
     - Horizontal scaling with multiple server instances
     - Load balancing
     - Model quantization for faster inference

3. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Add real-time latency monitoring
   - Implement alerting for performance degradation
   - Track resource utilization trends

## Next Steps

1. Implement batch processing for improved throughput
2. Add caching layer for frequently requested predictions
3. Set up automated performance testing in CI/CD pipeline
4. Implement horizontal scaling for production deployment
