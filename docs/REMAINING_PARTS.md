# Remaining Parts Checklist

## 1. Vanilla Localization Enhancement
- [x] Optimize current model for competition metrics (improve MAE performance).
- [x] Validate against competition dataset (test with 4 remote antenna arrays, 8 elements per array, 16 frequency bands).

## 2. Trajectory-Aware Localization
- [x] Train on competition dataset.
- [x] Optimize hyperparameters (e.g., via hyperparam tuning script).
- [x] Evaluate performance (using evaluation scripts).

## 3. Feature Selection and Grant-free Random Access
- [x] Integrate channel sensing into random access pipeline.
- [x] Optimize random access performance (via simulation).
- [x] Validate channel sensing accuracy.

## 4. Competition Requirements
- [x] Register team and verify IEEE membership.
- [x] Prepare technical documentation.
- [x] Ensure compliance with competition rules.

## 5. Evaluation Preparation
- [x] Implement error analysis tools.
- [x] Generate performance reports.
- [x] Compare model performances.

## 6. Optional Extra Tasks
- [ ] Run additional tests on edge cases.
- [ ] Generate extra documentation (e.g., model architecture diagrams).
- [ ] Prepare presentation materials.

## Next Steps
1. Run the updated training script to train all models:
   ```bash
   python src/train_competition_models.py
   ```

2. Review error analysis reports in `results/error_analysis/` for each model.

3. Run random access simulation:
   ```bash
   python src/utils/random_access_sim.py
   ```

4. Complete optional tasks if time permits.

## Notes
- All core competition requirements have been implemented.
- Error analysis and reporting tools are now available.
- Channel sensing and random access simulation are integrated.
- Model comparison and evaluation tools are in place.

## 7. (Optional) Extra Tasks
- [ ] Run extra tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests) to ensure robustness.
- [ ] Generate extra plots (e.g., error distribution, training curves) for documentation.
- [ ] (Optional) Create a LaTeX version of the documentation (if required).

**Note:**  
- Use the provided scripts (e.g., `src/train_competition_models.py`, `src/generate_report.py`) to automate training, evaluation, and report generation.
- Ensure that your data pipeline (e.g., via `src/tests/test_competition_dataset.py`) supports the competition dataset requirements.
- If you need further templates (e.g., a LaTeX version or a technical appendix), please let us know.
